# The Gengo API

The Gengo API allows you to globalize your service. Whether you're integrating a translation option for users, or you're building a unique translation business, our API handles a [variety of languages](/how-it-works/pricing-languages/) and [features](/api/).

The online API documentation here describes the resources comprising the official Gengo API. You can jump right in by browsing the resources on the right >>

The current version of the Gengo API is v2. If you have any problems or requests please contact [support](mailto:support@gengo.com?subject=Gengo API Inquiry).

For older versions of the Gengo API, you can view [previous API documentation](/legacy/).

## Upcoming Changes

We are working towards adding improved stability and better error messaging in response payloads. We have also recently changed the Gengo API documentation framework, so look for the [code]*[/code] symbol requesting special attention.

# Best Practices for Plugins & API Usage

The Gengo API, while versatile, is still the technical bare-bones plumbing necessary to integrate the benefits of translation into any application. If you're interested in building a plugin or application that uses the Gengo API, it's worth considering a few things. We've rounded up some information below that we've found helps make third party plugins and applications more successful in the long run.

##Use Gengo Passport to sign in

The Gengo API, like many others, relies on a system of API keys to sign and authenticate requests with. However, in most cases API keys as a system are less than ideal. Enter Gengo Passport, the simplest way to get users of your application authenticated with Gengo:

    #!javascript
    var passport = new MyGengoPassport({
        // Your application name
        appName: 'myWork',

        // HTML ID to set as the sign-in button
        button: 'mygengo_button',

        // Choose from 'largeBlue', 'largeWhite', 'smallBlue', 'smallWhite'
        buttonStyle: 'largeBlue',

        // Your custom function to run when they're signed in!
        on_authentication: function(data) {
            // data.public_key
            // data.private_key
        }
    });

All that's required to use this is to supply your application name, and users can be automatically taken through a process that authorizes your application to use their API keys. You'll need to store them yourself for later queries, but otherwise it's a simple one-step process that lets users hit the ground running on your application!

The flow will look a little something like this. At the moment it requires that the user already be signed up for Gengo, so we ask that you provide a link to register with us. We're working to release another version of Passport in the near future that will allow signing up from right within plugins.

<div id="mygengo_passport_signin" style="margin: 0 auto;"></div>

<div id="dat_form" style="display: none; margin: 0 auto 10px; width: 700px;">

    <p style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
                    <label style="display: block; font-weight: bold;">Your Public Key</label> <input id="public_key" style="width: 320px; padding: 3px; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #c9c9c9; border-radius: 2px; display: block;" value="" />
    </p>

    <p style="float: left;">
                    <label style="display: block; font-weight: bold;">Your Private Key</label> <input id="private_key" style="width: 320px; padding: 3px; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #c9c9c9; border-radius: 2px; display: block;" value="" />
    </p>
</div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://ogneg.com/js/passport.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">
        var passport = new MyGengoPassport({
            appName: 'myWork',
            button: document.getElementById('mygengo_passport_signin'),
            buttonStyle: 'largeBlue',
modal: false,
            on_authentication: function(data) {
                document.getElementById('public_key').value = data.public_key;
                document.getElementById('private_key').value = data.private_key;
                $('#dat_form').slideDown('slow');
            }
        });
</script>

##Terms that make sense

In terms of interacting with the Gengo API, data is shuttled back and forth as a "job". However, the typical interaction level a user has with Gengo finds them requesting "translations", and almost nowhere are they made aware of the concept of a "job". Consistency with the core Gengo experience ensures a user won't be confused when requesting translations in an otherwise foreign space.

## Provide in-depth headers

As the Gengo third party ecosystem continues to grow and generate traffic, it becomes more difficult to discern whether a specific version of an application is running into problems. Since the API is very "write-heavy", it's beneficial to be able to narrow down how bad translation requests make it into the system. If you provide us proper header information, we can spot this as it comes up and work with you to ensure your application is working as it needs to.

If you're not using one of <a href='/overview/client_libraries/'>our programming libraries</a> that are on tap, we ask that you send us a User-Agent in the following format:

Gengo app_name; Version app_version; your_site_url;

The documentation provided by the libraries we offer should give examples on how to provide app information. Any questions related to the libraries themselves can be asked on their respective repositories over at <a href='http://github.com/mygengo'>our GitHub account</a>.

## Group jobs that belong together

A common issue translators run into is missing context on a job. Translations are rarely a one-to-one match, and providing as much context as possible ensures that translators will understand what actually needs to be said. <a href='http://gengo.com/api/developer-docs/methods/translate-jobs-post/'>Gengo supports grouping jobs together</a> so that they'll all go through the same translator, meaning that there's little to no loss of context when the translator goes to work.

Blog posts are a superb example of this. If you're integrating with a blog client (WordPress, MovableType, etc) to translate posts, you should ensure that all aspects of the post are sent at once - title, body, and anything else that might apply. By doing this you enable the translator to see the bigger picture, and it results in less hassle and possible confusion for the user.

## Be mindful of rate limits

We're pretty generous with rate limits, but it's still possible to run up against them. To avoid this happening, try to be mindful of the number of requests you make to the API - for instance, if jobs can be grouped together, it's wise to do it so it all goes to Gengo in one request as opposed to several. Take advantage of our lazy-loading capabilities; we'll POST a job to you when it's completed, excessive polling isn't always necessary (or recommended!).

##Make sure users know they can escape text!

This one is a bit more of a "power user" feature, but it's one that we still find our customers using fairly consistently. In any given translation, blocks of text can be marked as "do not translate". Said text simply needs to be surrounded in triple brackets - example:

My teacher gave us [[[ 7 apples ]]] today.

In the above example, "7 apples" would be left untouched by the translator.
